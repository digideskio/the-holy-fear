## The Holy Fear

The code used to create the content in this blog post:

### Using this

The code here covers only the generation of the text and its representation as a variety of data files. This does not include the renderer that shows the text on my blog. But to generate the data, use the following two commands:

```
rake create
```

```
rake render
```
